# CSUBatch
This was a group project for Software Engineering.
This program allows you to submit a job with a time and priority into a queue with "run", where jobs are then executed by a dispatching module. A scheduling module is used to schedule the jobs by order of different algorithms, such as fcfs, sjf, and priority.
